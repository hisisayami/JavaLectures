    Object Oriented Programming Features
        Abstraction
        Encapsulation
        Inheritance
        Polymorphism


        1. Inheritance (Parent and child class) -- Keyword = extend
        2. Encapsulation = Hide the data
        3.Abstraction = keep the common value in one class
        4.Polymorphism = you can create multiple implementation of a single values..

        1. Inheritance (parent and child class)  --Keyword = extend

            Code Test que:

            1.Demo class (main)

            1.Animal class
            -int age;
            -int runSpeed;
            -String name;

            --Method
            -move (void)

            --Child class 1.Cat 2.Dog
            reuse the method and variable from super class..


        2. Encapsulation


        3.Abstraction
            -An abstract class has no use until unless it is extended by some other class.
            -If you declare an abstract method in a class then you must declare the class abstract as well.
                you cant have abstract method in a concrete class.
                Its vice versa is not always true: If a class is not having any abstract method then also
                it can be marked as abstract.
            -It can have non-abstract method (concrete) as well.

            some basics and example of abstract method
            1) Abstract methods has no body.
            2) Always end the deceleration with a semicolon (;).
            3) It must be overridden. An abstract class must be extended and in a same way abstract method must be overridden.
            4) A class has to be declared abstract to have abstract method.
